# Design Document: bash-admin-tools

## Objective
Develop a collection of Bash scripts to automate common system administration tasks to improve efficiency and consistency.

## Scope
Initial focus on:
- User creation automation
- Disk cleanup with archiving
- Log parsing with alert alerts

## Features & Roadmap
- Week 1: Basic scripts as proof of concept
- Week 2-3: Add dry-run mode and enhanced logging
- Week 4: Integrate cron scheduling and CLI flags

## Architecture
- Modular, standalone Bash scripts
- Each script handles one primary function
- Output and alerts through terminal and logs

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Target system is a Linux environment with Bash shell
- Scripts will run with appropriate privileges (sudo where needed)
- Minimal external dependencies to maximize portability
